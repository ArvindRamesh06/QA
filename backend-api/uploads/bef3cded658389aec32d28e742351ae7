Here's a step-by-step guide for developers:\n\n### **Step 1:** Express Interest\n  Initiate the access request by sending an email to our dedicated support team at psd2@partnersbanka.cz, expressing your interest in using the PSD2 API. Provide information about your organization and the intended use of the API.\n\n### **Step 2:** QSeal Certificate Submission\n  Attach the public part of your organization's QSeal certificate to the email. This certificate is essential for secure communication between your systems and the PSD2 API. Ensure the certificate adheres to the specified security standards outlined in the API documentation.\n\n### **Step 3:** Access Verification\n  Our support team will promptly review your request and verify the provided QSeal certificate. This process ensures the legitimacy of your access request and compliance with regulatory standards.\n\n### **Step 4:** OAuth2 Authorization Credentials\n  Upon successful verification, you will receive a notification confirming the approval of your access request. This communication will include the necessary OAuth2 authorization credentials - ```client_id``` and ```client_secret``` - enabling secure access to the PSD2 API. See **Authorization** section.\n\n### **Step 5:** Integration and Support\n  With access granted, proceed with integrating the PSD2 API into your applications using the provided OAuth2 credentials and the endpoint details. Our support team is available to assist you with any questions or challenges encountered during the integration process.\n\n  By following this streamlined access request procedure, you can quickly and securely access the PSD2 API using your organization's QSeal certificate. This efficient process allows you to focus on integrating the API seamlessly into your applications, obtaining the OAuth2 credentials necessary for a secure and compliant authorization process within the regulatory framework of PSD2.\n\n## Introduction to Digest Signature Authorization for API Security\n  Securing API communication is paramount in the digital landscape, and one effective method is through the use of a digest signature. This introduction provides insights into API authorization using a digest signature composed of selected HTTP headers.\n\n### Why Digest Signature?\n  APIs handle sensitive data and transactions, demanding robust security measures. Digest signatures offer a cryptographic approach to authenticate and ensure the integrity of API requests. By incorporating selected HTTP headers into the signature, this method provides a secure means of authorization.\n\n### How Digest Signature Works\n  Digest signatures involve the creation of a unique hash value based on selected elements of the HTTP request. These elements typically include headers such as ```Date```, and ```Content-Type```. The hash, commonly created using cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256, serves as a unique fingerprint for the request.\n\n### Benefits of Digest Signature Authorization\n  1. **Enhanced Security:** Digest signatures add an extra layer of security by ensuring that the request's content and headers remain unchanged during transmission.\n  2. **Protection Against Replay Attacks:** The timestamp in the digest signature prevents replay attacks, as the server can validate the freshness of the request.\n  3. **Selective Authorization:**  By choosing specific headers for inclusion in the digest, API providers can control which parts of the request contribute to the signature, offering flexibility in authorization.\n  4. **Cryptographic Integrity:** The cryptographic nature of the digest signature ensures that even a minor alteration to the request results in a vastly different signature, providing a robust mechanism for detecting tampering.\n\n### Implementing Digest Signature Authorization\n  To implement digest signature authorization, developers must follow a predefined algorithm to construct the signature based on selected headers. The server, in turn, verifies the signature using the same algorithm, ensuring the request's authenticity.\n\n### Getting Started\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive guide on implementing API authorization through digest signatures. Explore the step-by-step process, sample code snippets, and best practices to seamlessly integrate digest signature authorization into your API communication.\n\nEmbrace the power of digest signatures to fortify your API against unauthorized access and tampering. Elevate the security posture of your applications by adopting this robust method of API authorization, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your data in transit.\n\n## Authorization by signature in the request header\n  * TPP (Third Party Provider) uses its QSeal certificate to call the signed request header\n  * In each call, TPP sends a signed digest of selected header parameters in the header according to the defined algorithm\n  * The API verifies the hash and signature of selected request headers\n  * The TPP Admin checks the JERRS and CA register\n\n### Headers for signature algorithm\n  The algorithm is described in detail for each API endpoint. It expects to add these parameters to the request header:\n\n  | Parameter | Description | Example |\n  |---|---|---|\n  | Digest | Digest according to RFC3230 containing the algorithm. The digest is created as a hash of a string composed of the values of the headers specified in the sign structure. | sha-256=449d8432503f072092ad6e2c71e4b44... |\n  | Signature | A structure describing the content of the signature, its algorithm and BASE64 value of the signature in the form of a structured string. <br/>Format:<br/>algorithm=\\\"{0}\\\",headers=\\\"{1}\\\",signature=\\\"{2}\\\" |  c29a002951a81688c00000.... |\n  | TPP-Signature-Certificate | Base64 public part of the certificate (without envelope) | MIIDzDCCArSgAwIBAgIJAPwpq5bhcUyaMA0GCSq...  |\n\n> **Warning**\n>\n> *Please be aware that any attempt to use hashing algorithms other than **SHA-256** to generate header signatures will result in errors and the failure of the signature validation process. It is recommended to adhere to the SHA-256 standard to ensure compatibility and security.*\n>\n> **For proper functionality**, it is important to insert the parameter values in the hash string consecutively without a separator, i.e. valueofX-Request-IDvalueofDate  \n\n### Example of headers and procedure for a specific request\n  ```http\n  X-Correlation-Id: c3a95adb-05d5-4b56-a8ac-54d7a2f97645\n  X-Request-ID: 36e65182-7a28-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002\n  User-Involved: true\n  Authorization: Bearer 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08\n  Date: Wed, 22 Oct 2023 07:28:00 GMT\n  Digest: SHA256=8adb0cce2022c23bacefa0843260ca54835a16eb64376f98b8f0cb98686802d1\n  Signature: algorithm=\"SHA256withRSA\",headers=\"date x-request-id\",signature=\"UqIFDmRRG/j2/pqxMYLHw9XY47rdlz3Wto03C9GraneaZNfHvdKYlwgGw/Bl3uQbZTLTfC+FIhosiLCS0njeL/KuDgLyJTMf1dI/nwoZAduWEiFxlp61rV4OLWWrJO9TSRoE7y+PKDX+9CClGMD0VqD0pQgxipOrEJv9a/Xv0J2sJuHlaiwLrAuH9PtAMhi91vWlXyz2ws7Z4F4ZNIYzrluYNLQ6Tml7lZj7I2jLjj/1MBBZCnZlksg4RUMHDmwkVy4NaP6fUl4+me3YGUd0pGqfyDwO0JCPBOFjL67i/el64DzhdtfjVqNsDfkt8sDe9tM/JC+mRRIGYQ95xw/fAg==\"\n  TPP-Signature-Certificate: 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\n  ```"

        # **OAuth 2.0 Code Grant Flow: A Comprehensive Guide**
          OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted framework for securing APIs and web applications. The Code Grant Flow is one of the most secure and commonly used OAuth 2.0 flows for obtaining access tokens. This section provides a comprehensive guide on the OAuth 2.0 Code Grant Flow within the context of API security.

        ## Overview
          The Code Grant Flow is designed to facilitate secure access to protected resources without exposing user credentials to unauthorized parties. It involves a series of steps between the client application, the authorization server, and the resource server. The primary actors in this flow are the client application, the authorization server, and the resource owner.

        ## **Steps in the OAuth 2.0 Code Grant Flow**

          1. Authorization Request: The client initiates the flow by redirecting the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) to the authorization server's authorization endpoint. The request includes parameters such as client ID, redirect URI, and the desired scope of access.
          2. User Consent: The resource owner authenticates and provides consent to the client application. The authorization server validates the user's credentials and ensures the requested scopes are approved.
          3. Authorization Code Generation: Upon successful authentication and consent, the authorization server issues an authorization code and redirects the user-agent back to the client's specified redirect URI.
          4. Token Request: The client, now possessing the authorization code, makes a secure, back-channel request to the authorization server's token endpoint. The request includes the authorization code, client credentials, and the redirect URI.
          5. Access Token Retrieval: The authorization server validates the authorization code, client credentials, and redirect URI. Upon successful validation, it issues an access token to the client.
          6. Access Token Usage: The client can now use the obtained access token to make authorized requests to the resource server on behalf of the resource owner. The resource server validates the access token and responds with the requested resource if the token is valid.
          7. Refresh Token Issuance: It's essential to note that for the issuance of a refresh token, the client must include the offline_access scope in the initial authorization request. If approved, the authorization server issues a refresh token along with the access token.

        ## **Security Considerations**

          1. **HTTPS Usage:** All communications involved in the Code Grant Flow, including the initial authorization request and subsequent token exchange, should occur over HTTPS to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
          2. **Client Authentication:** Clients must authenticate themselves when exchanging the authorization code for an access token, adding an extra layer of security.
          3. Token Storage and Handling: Properly secure the access token, store it securely, and implement mechanisms for token refreshing to maintain secure, long-lived sessions.
          4. Refresh Tokens: The inclusion of the offline_access scope is mandatory for the authorization server to issue a refresh token. This allows the client to obtain a new access token without requiring user interaction.

        Digest according to RFC3230 that contains an algorithm. The digest is created as a hash of a string composed of header values specified in the Signature structure.


        How to generate the hash?


        1. Create a string of header values based on the "headers" specified in the "Signature" header. The header values must be in given order without separator





            - example:
                - Signature header: algorithm="SHA256withRSA",headers="uri authorization date x-request-id",signature="ZmFzZGZhc2RmYXNkZmtmYWpzZGZhNnM1ZGY5YThzZDRmNmY0YTZzZDg0ZjZhc2Q4ZjZhc2Q4NGZhNnNkODRmYXNkZg=="
                - String to be hashed: "GET /my/accounts/08230397-3824-4e9e-918a-1f519eb31d9f/balanceBearer 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08Wed, 22 Oct 2023 07:28:00 GMT36e65182-7a28-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002"


        2. Make a hash based on the "algorithm" specified in the "Signature" header.

      schema:
        type: string
      required: true
      example: 'sha-256=7dd520f3d524f7c3c04b0b98e961007032f0d0df30cfa858a4d68c4a4e4507e4'
    Signature:
      in: header
      name: Signature
      description: >
        A structure describing, in the form of a structured string, the content of the signature, its algorithm, and the BASE64 value of the signature.


        Possible headers to be signed (depends on the endpoint):


        - uri


        - authorization


        - date


        - x-request-id

      schema:
        type: string
      required: true
      example: 'algorithm="SHA256withRSA",headers="uri authorization date x-request-id",signature="ZmFzZGZhc2RmYXNkZmtmYWpzZGZhNnM1ZGY5YThzZDRmNmY0YTZzZDg0ZjZhc2Q4ZjZhc2Q4NGZhNnNkODRmYXNkZg=="'
